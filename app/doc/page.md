# Aurelia Value Converters
An overview of the [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io) framework's value

This page is written using Aurelia and contains **live examples**.  The full

## Data Binding

A short description of data-binding from the Aurelia
[docs](http://aurelia.io/docs.html):

*In Aurelia, user interface elements are composed of view and view-model
pairs. The view is written with HTML and is rendered into the DOM. The
view-model is written with JavaScript and provides data and behavior to
the view.  Aurelia's powerful databinding links the two pieces together
allowing changes in your data to be reflected in the view and vice versa.*
